## Volun-Clear!

Universal Good’s Corporate Social Responsibility department just started up and already has hundreds of employees looking to participate in dozens of events throughout the year. Its admins are overwhelmed by their coworkers’ altruism, and they want to better support their collective efforts around the clock with an intuitive user experience.

### Requirements

- Volunteering opportunities, including their capacity & date, can be created and published by Salesforce admins (“coordinators”)
- Salesforce users (“volunteers”) can select volunteering opportunities through Chatter or any intuitive user interface
- Volunteers can see which opportunities their peers are interested in and leave comments on the event
- Volunteers can only sign up for up to 4 opportunities each calendar year (**Bonus**: They can also cancel their involvement up to 48 hours before the start of the event)
- The user interface clearly indicates when an opportunity is full so that volunteers aren’t surprised when they try to sign up

### Supported Learning

- Nonprofit Success Pack and Volunteers for Salesforce (V4S) (see [related Trailhead trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/nonprofit_volunteer)!)
- Community Builder (see [related Trailhead module](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/communities/modules/community_rollout_impl))
